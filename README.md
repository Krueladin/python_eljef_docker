### ElJef Docker

The ElJef Docker API provides functionality for operating with docker
containers.

The Docker API is a Python 3.6+ only API.

#### Programs

eljef-docker manages docker containers and groups of docker containers.
It is meant for setups that have docker containers running that are in
groups, dependant upon one container being up and running before the
others.

#### API Documentation

API documentation requires Sphinx to build.
You can build API documentation by moving to the docs folder and running
"make html".
